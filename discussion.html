    	<h1>A Note on the Idea of Internet Usage</h1>
    	<p>One things user may notice is the lack of network communication between the Google Chrome extension and the Android app. Although it could possibly make the system more convenient to use, we decided against implenting this for various reasons. By taking out any possibility of network communication, the security of the key exchange simply becomes a matter of ensuring physical security, typing the key in discretely, rather than a matter of software or network security.</p>
    	<h1>Future Features</h1>
    		<ul>
    			<li><b>Backup Service: </b>Currently, there is no backup system for our extension. If a user or attacker uninstalls the extension, we do not have a way to export the passwords or import the passwords for future use.</li>
    			<li><b>Account Recovery: </b>If a user loses the smart phone originally associated with the extension, then there is no way to access your accounts. One solution that Google provides is to allow the users to print a sheet of pre-defined pins that they can use one time to temporarily allow them access to their accounts. A similar mechanism to allow a user to make their accounts available should be developed for this extension that is both secure and still convenient.</li>
    			<li><b>Cloud Services: </b>Currently the passwords are only available on the original machine they are associated with. By implementing communication with cloud storage, all the passwords should be available from any machine while still having the security of two factor authentication.</li>
    			<li><b>Customizable Password Generation: </b>Different websites require different constraints on their passwords. For example, some require special symbols and some do not allow it at all. Allowing the user to modify which constraints are required would make the system much more accessable to users.</li>
    			<li><b>iOS App: </b>We chose to create an Android app as a prototype because of expertise within our team. Because there is large population of consumers using Apple devices, it would be ideal to create an iOS port.</li>
    		</ul>
    	<h1>Possible Attacks on the System</h1>
    	<p>The whole system is based on the protection of the key generated when the app first opens. The extension and the app uses this key to encrypt and decrypt messages. If for whatever reason this key is modified, then the whole system will fail.</p>
    	<p>With this in mind, we can discuss some possible areas for attack.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><b>Attacker obtaining the key:</b></li>
    		<p>If the attacker is present when the key is generated on the screen of the app, it could be possible for them to copy the key. We leave it as a responsibility of the user to ensure that no one is watching them enter the key.</p>
    		<p>It may be possible for the attacker to obtain the key from the local storage of the extension. This was considered and is a security trade off based on the scope and timeframe of the project. Physical protection of computer containing the extension should be a top priority of the user. </p>

    		<p>It is also possible for an attacker if they access the local storage of the Android device. Accessing the SQLite database of the app requires root privileges on the device. We leave it to the user to prevent attackers from having access to both the Android device and computer having the Google Chrome extension.</p>

    		<li><b>Phishing:</b></li>
    		<p>Phishing is an attempt by an attacker to disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity in order to obtain sensitive information. Often, attackers will create websites that are visually similar to popular websites with URL's that resemble the original website's URL. If a user is not observant, they may accidentally give away their credentials to this fake websites</p>
    		<p>Our extension does its best to prevent phishing attempts by only presenting the appropriate passwords to URL's that are equivalent to the URL stored by the extension. However, various features of web languages, such as Javascript and HTML5, can help attackers alter the URL's of a fake page without notifying the user. Future versions of the system could use some tests and assertions to verify webpage and notify the user if they are not on the intended site.</p>
    		</p>
